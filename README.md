# Shopify 2022 Internship Backend Development Challenge
Hello! If you're seeing this you're likely here to evaluate my submission. If you're unfamiliar with c++ and don't have a local IDE with which to run CPP files,
rather than go through that arduous labor, simply visit an online C++ compiler and paste the shopifyCRUD.cpp file. I personally reocommend https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler.

Otherwise, I've included the full folder with the Visual Studio Solution. This contains an identical C++ file to execute.
